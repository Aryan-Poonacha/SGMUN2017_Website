<br>
Our world is in peril. It has been, for a long time. Every day, we see endless onslaughts between nations, in a never-ending struggle to assert power over one another. Weapons are produced, used and abused. So are humans. In such acrimonious times, there is a serious need for diplomacy. We needed a body that would ensure global disarmament, prevent the rise of non-state actors, and make our world a safer place. And thus, with the United Nations General Assembly came its first and most important committee, tasked with looking at the big picture, and preventing the proliferation of WMDs and other such abuses to liberty. From issues like the safety of our waters and pirating, to the prevalent role played by private military contractors, there is no crisis in the world that is not under our purview. The distortion of international security and harmony will not be tolerated. We have to ensure the safety of the people from any threat, for the people are the last resolve. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing GA-1, the DISEC.
<br>
<h3 class="committee-heading">Agenda</h3>
<br>
1.	Issue of security in international waters with special emphasis on pirates in Somalia
<br>
2.	Private military corporations and their regulation

Hate crimes. Cultural conflict. "Job Stealing". Integration of first generation immigrants into mainstream society is more relevant than ever before. Economic and industrial espionage- the rising tide of such incidents, setting the stage for what could possible be the next Cold War. The ECOSOC is the United Nations’ central platform for reflection, debate, and innovative thinking on sustainable development.
<br>
Come. Discuss. Debate. Save the world from the impending pandemonium of society and economy.
<h3 class="committee-heading">Agenda</h3>
<br>
1.	Discussing the social and economic integration of first generation immigrants
<br>
2.	Solutions to the threats posed by rising economic espionage

-Vladimir Putin

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is undoubtedly the most powerful and influential rooms on the face of this planet. The only committee of the United Nations that can enforce binding resolutions, its unique representation designed to include vantages and perspectives from every ethnic and geopolitical background makes the UNSC best equipped to deal with crises and armed conflict with maximum efficiency.
<br>
However, delegates, do remember that with great power comes great responsibility.
<h3 class="committee-heading">Agenda</h3>
<br>
Review of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, with special reference to Libya
<br>
<h3 class="committee-heading">Reserve Agenda</h3>
<br>
The question of sovereignty of states, with special reference to the Mali conflict

Opiate trade. Human trafficking. Migrant smuggling. Drug money. Terrorism. Crime. This agency of the United Nation is committed to fighting against illicit drugs and transnational organised crime. The UNODC came into operation in 1997 through a merger between the then United Nations Drug Control Programme and the Centre for International Crime Prevention.
<br>
The UNODC’s activities have significantly intensified over the past decade with rising instances of global terrorism and drug trafficking. Bearing in mind the relevance of the agency and it’s activities in contemporary times, the SGMUN UNODC 2017 proposes discussion on the following topics.
<br>
<h3 class="committee-heading">Agenda</h3>
<br>
1.	Discussing the decriminalisation of recreational substances globally
<br>
2.	Transnational Operation of human trafficking with focus on sexual exploitation in Asia

      <div class="panel-heading"><p class="committee-heading">Court Of Emperor Aurelian<p></div>
      <div class="panel-body"><p class="committee-text">“Faced with crisis, the man of character falls back on himself. He imposes his own stamp of action, takes responsibility for it, makes it his own.”
        <br>
-Charles de Gaulle
<br>
They say Rome had lurched from crisis to crisis ever since its foundation- but none were as bad as The Crisis of The Third Century- described by many as one of the darkest periods in the history of the Roman Empire. Ineffective rulers were unable to handle the economic, humanitarian and political issues unfolding in front of them, which meant the onus of stabilising Rome fell into the hands of Emperor Aurelian
<br>
A simulation of a council called together by Emperor Aurelian to tackle the plethora of problems caused by the crisis along with pre existing unaddressed problems, the council would be expected to redefine the limits of logic and creativity, considering the unpredictability and the instability of the Empire; the ultimate aim being the gargantuan task of beginning to reunite a factionalised Roman Empire.
<br>
Presenting to you, the Court of Emperor Aurelian.
