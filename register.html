    Dear Delegates,
    <br>
It gives me great pleasure to invite you to the 2017 edition of Sishu Griha Model United
Nations. This year’s conference will be held from the 27th to the 29th of July. Our team has
put in an immense amount of effort to ensure that this will be the best conference Sishu
Griha has ever seen.
<br>
I started Model UN in the eighth grade right here in Sishu Griha, and almost immediately fell
in love with the entire concept. It built my confidence not only as a speaker, but also as an
individual gearing up to take on the world and its many nuances. As they say, doubt kills
more dreams than failure ever will, which is why confidence is one of the most valuable traits
available to an individual, and one that I believe Model UN, more than anything else,
inculcates in each and every one of us. Another quality that Model UN instills in us is that of
actually listening, and looking at things from different perspectives, which are traits that I
truly believe can help alleviate the terrible conflict in the tumultuous world that we live in.
Moreover, my experiences on the European Model UN circuit this past year, including
heading a simulation in the United Nations Office at Geneva itself, have taught me one
essential lesson: Diplomacy trumps all. Taking into account a variety of distinct interests and
drafting a resolution in the spirit of compromise is how things work in the real world, contrary
to the increasingly aggressive nature of Model UN that we see time and again on our
country’s circuit. What better platform to implement this change in approach than SGMUN, a
conference established to act as a stepping stone exclusively for young delegates aspiring to
make a name for themselves in the Model UN arena. I am convinced that this bottom-up
approach will lead to achieving the realistic sense of diplomacy that our circuit needs more
than ever.
<br>
Whether you want to work towards worldwide disarmament, or wish to improve global social
conditions through economic mechanisms; whether you revel in the intense and far-reaching
debate of the Security Council, thrive in the element of unknown held by a continuous crisis
committee, or enjoy putting an end to transnational drug cartels- SGMUN 2017 has
something that you will love. Furthermore, to all the experienced delegates reading this,
worry not! Despite SGMUN primarily catering to first-timers, two of our committees this year
will be open to 11th graders. In short, SGMUN 2017 promises to be a unique and amazing
learning experience, whether it’s your first conference or your tenth. I look forward to
meeting all of you in July!
<br>
Best,
<br>
Siddharth Abraham
<br>
Secretary General
<br>
Sishu Griha Model United Nations 2017,</p>
